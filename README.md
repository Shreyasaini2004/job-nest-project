# JobNest Project

A modern job portal application built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, with realistic company verification.

## Features

- Job seeker and employer registration
- Company email domain verification
- Modern UI with responsive design
- Form validation with Zod
- Toast notifications

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`

## Company Email Verification

The application uses email domain verification to confirm company affiliation - a realistic and industry-standard approach used by platforms like LinkedIn.

### How It Works

1. **Company Name**: User enters their company name
2. **Company Email**: User provides their company email address
3. **Domain Verification**: System checks if email domain matches company name
4. **Verification**: Confirms user's affiliation with the company

### Verification Process

#### **Step 1: Enter Company Information**
- Company name (e.g., "Acme Corporation")
- Company email (e.g., "john@acmecorp.com")

#### **Step 2: Domain Matching**
- System extracts domain from email (@acmecorp.com)
- Checks if domain contains company name keywords
- Validates domain-company name correlation

#### **Step 3: Verification Status**
- **‚úÖ Verified**: Domain matches company name
- **‚ùå Failed**: Domain doesn't match company name
- **üîÑ Verifying**: Processing verification

### Examples of Valid Company Emails

| Company Name | Valid Email | Domain Match |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|
| Acme Corporation | john@acmecorp.com | ‚úÖ acmecorp matches Acme |
| Tech Startup | sarah@techstartup.in | ‚úÖ techstartup matches Tech Startup |
| Infosys | rahul@infosys.com | ‚úÖ infosys matches Infosys |
| Tata Consultancy | priya@tcs.com | ‚úÖ tcs matches Tata Consultancy |

### Benefits

‚úÖ **Realistic**: Industry-standard verification method
‚úÖ **Simple**: No complex APIs or external dependencies
‚úÖ **Universal**: Works for any company with a domain
‚úÖ **Secure**: Based on actual company email ownership
‚úÖ **User-Friendly**: Familiar verification process

### Technical Implementation

The verification system:
- Extracts email domain using JavaScript
- Performs keyword matching between domain and company name
- Handles common domain variations (.com, .in, .org, etc.)
- Provides real-time feedback during verification
- Stores verification status in user profile

## Development

The application uses:
- **React** with TypeScript
- **Vite** for build tooling
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling

4. **Status Display**: Shows verification result
5. **Success/Failure**: Clear feedback with next steps

### User Experience
